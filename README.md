Hi! Thank you for visiting my personal project. Here are the packages needed:
1. matplotlib
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. requests
5. yfinance
(open command center and pip install if needed)

The project is done in a Jupyter Notebook environment, ensure that you run each segment before the final one "main"
Make sure to input the right tickers and formatting. I.e. AAPL,MSFT,TSLA,KO,XOM,NVDA,INTC   (or just copy this as a prove of concept for the code)

Enjoy! And I sincerely hope no errors occur.
*Ensure that you are connected to the internet as the code pulls data from 2 APIs, alphavantage and yfinance*
